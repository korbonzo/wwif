In Front of Yellow Building
There is a bright yellow building to the north, its door wide open.  The only sounds you hear come from the chirping birds around you.

Vestibule
A kinda dark drabby brown looking area.  There is a door to the east leading to an office and a staircase leading up.

Upstairs Hallway
Three doors to the north, south, and east are accessible from this hallway.

Office
There is a mess of papers scattered on the floor.  A broken computer screen lies on a desk.
